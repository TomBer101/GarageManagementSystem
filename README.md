# Garage Management System 🚗⚒️

## Overview

Welcome to the Garage Management System, a project developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course using C# and the .NET Framework.
This application serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental OOP concepts, including inheritance, encapsulation, and composition.

## Project Description

The Garage Management System is designed to handle various types of vehicles within a garage.
It showcases some of the OOP principles:

🏍️ **Inheritance:** Different vehicle types (e.g., cars, motorcycles) inherit common attributes and behaviors from a base Vehicle class. 
  
🚙 **Encapsulation:** Properties and methods are encapsulated within classes, ensuring data integrity and providing a clear interface for interacting with objects.

🚜 **Composition:** Flexible Engine Options

One of the key features of this project is the use of composition, particularly in the context of the vehicle's engine.
The design allows a vehicle to be powered by either a gas engine or an electric engine, showcasing the flexibility and extensibility achieved through composition.


## Key Features 🔑

- **Vehicle Types:** Manage different types of vehicles, each with its own set of properties and behaviors.

- **Garage Operations:** Perform actions like add fuel, charge, air, servicing, and retrieving vehicles from the garage.


## Project Reflection 🪞

While this project may be considered "basic" within the scope of my degree, I thoroughly enjoyed working on it.
It provided a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of OOP concepts and challenged me to think strategically about when and why to apply each concept.
As I delved into the intricacies of inheritance, encapsulation, and composition, I gained a newfound appreciation for the elegance and flexibility they bring to software design.

Feel free to explore the code and discover how these OOP principles come to life in the Garage Management System.
